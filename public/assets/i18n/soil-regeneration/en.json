It mentions how soil is essential for life as it is home to millions of species and is the place where plants produce our food. In addition, soil helps filter and purify water, stores carbon, and helps regulate the climate. It also mentions the importance of caring for and protecting the soil to ensure its long-term health and productivity. In summary, the video highlights the importance of soil as a vital resource and how its conservation is essential for our survival...",

        "crustsQuestion": "Are crusts visible on the surface?",
        "crustsAnswer": "Crusting on the soil is an indicator of physical degradation, it is likely that your soil has gone through periods without living or dead plant cover, exposed to environmental factors that generate desiccation, compaction, and compaction, these are signs that may be compromising the fertility of the soil in the long term. Crusting is a common problem in soils with little agglomeration. It results primarily from the impact of raindrops, causing the clay particles on the surface to disperse and close the pores immediately below the surface.The rains that follow are likely to run off rather than be absorbed into the soil.",
        "saltsQuestion": "Are salts observed on the surface?",
        "saltsAnswer": "The presence of salts is common in soils of arid areas or saline soils, if you are not in this type of environment and salts are present on the surface, control the quality of irrigation water as salts may be incorporated through the water, in the case of saline water, the quantities of water provided should be increased to avoid salinization of the soil, the presence of salts on the surface is common in crops under cover where rainfall does not reach the soil.",
        "waterInfiltrationQuestion": "Do you have water infiltration problems that you did not have in the past?",
        "waterInfiltrationAnswer": "The water infiltration capacity of the soil is associated with both its texture and structure. Texture refers to the amount of silt, clay, and sand that a soil has, this condition is genetic and cannot be changed by management. The structure of soil is of a qualitative nature and is associated with the spatial arrangement of the particles, and their ability to stay in a certain spatial arrangement, The structure in turn determines the air spaces in the soil, this means its porosity and its capacity to provide a suitable environment for plant growth. The infiltration problems are often caused by the loss of soil structure, which is associated with aggressive tillage, and exposure of the soil to environmental factors such as rainfall, wind, loss of organic matter, and loss of biological activity.",
        "aggregatesQuestion": "Are aggregates visualized?",
        "aggregatesAnswer1": "Soil aggregates are groupings of particles, that are part of the soil structure, and they can be easily seen near the roots of plants, They provide structural stability to soils as they generate pore spaces, through which water and airflow, which plants need to live. The presence of soil aggregates is a good indicator of soil health. It is desirable to have a crumbly structure in the first 30 cm, a porous structure that allows good infiltration and air circulation.",
        "aggregatesAnswer2": "The opposite of aggregation is dispersion. In dispersed soil, each individual soil particle is free to be blown away by the wind or washed away by a flowing water stream. If they are not easily visualized, it is possible that our soil lacks adequate structure for plant development, This leads to problems of both infiltration and air circulation.",
        "evaluateSoilQuestion": "Do you want to evaluate the fertility of your soil through a questionnaire?",
        "evaluateSoilAnswer": "In the soil there are a series of factors that determine its level of fertility, which is why it is of utmost importance to know about them",
        "cropsLocationQuestion": "Do you have crops located on slopes greater than 1%?",
