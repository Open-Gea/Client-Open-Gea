      "The purpose of this functionality is to identify the deviation of rainfall and temperatures compared to historical records for the precise coordinates of the selected farm. It provide san overview of the increase or decrease of these variables over a range of time; weekly, monthly or quarterly. The user must select the farm, the variable to compare (precipitation or temperature), and the time range of the forecast. The user must also select a date for that range. Once all fields are selected, the application will return a corresponding analysis."
